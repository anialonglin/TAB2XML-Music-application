# TAB2XML
A Music application that converts a given music tablature into music score. 
## Description
TAB2XML is a Java application that converts music tablature into MusicXML, a file format 
that represents musical notation. However, reading a MusicXML file is a tedious task. 
The new update introduces the ability to preview any specific MusicXML file created from a 
given tablature into Music Scores for better understanding. 

Additionally, the new update includes two other features. Playing the notes 
(currently only for guitar tablature) and ability to print/save as Pdf. 

Currently, only guitar and drum tablature are supported, but more instruments and additional 
features, such as allowing the user to navigate to specific measures, will be added in future 
releases. 

### Intended Use

This application is intended to help both novice and expert music 
learners by allowing them to see a tablature in three different forms:
 tablature, music XML, and music sheet.

## Help

When you open the project in the Gradle task window or run it for the first time, 
it is likely that you will face some errors. In this section we will discuss some 
methods you can try to fix these errors:

<ol>
	<li>
		Under Preferences &#8594; Java &#8594; Installed JREs make sure you have JRE 17	
		<p align="center">

## Using TAB2XML

The current version works only with the following two examples:

#### Guitar tab example:
<pre style="font-family:courier;">
|-----------0-----|-0---------------|
|---------0---0---|-0---------------|
|-------1-------1-|-1---------------|
|-----2-----------|-2---------------|
|---2-------------|-2---------------|
|-0---------------|-0---------------|
</pre>

#### Drum tab example:

</pre>

#### Bass tab example: 
<pre style="font-family:courier;">
G|---------------|
D|-4-4-4-------4-|

### Instrument: Guitar

By entering the Guitar tablature from above, the system is able to:

1.	Properly convert it into a music sheet. 
2.	print the music sheet or save it as a PDF file in the print dialogue (currently only works once) 
3.	Play the notes and chord from beginning to end 
4.	Vertical scrolling for long measures
5.	By entering a measure number, highlight the corresponding measure on the screen
6.	Allow users to return to the input window and update the tablature without the need to close the current preview window.  

Unavailable functionalities: Pausing the playing capability

#### To preview the Guitar tablature:
<ol>
	<li>
		Run the application as noted in the previous section (Gradle task window &#8594;

### Instrument: DrumSet

The Application support the same functionalities and features for Drumset as 
it does for the Guitar tablatures.

Following the same steps as the guitar example, but with the example drum tablature, this is the output:

### Instrument: Bass

The Application support the same functionalities and features for Bass as 
it does for the Guitar and DrumSet tablatures.
